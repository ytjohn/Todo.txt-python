    :alt: Build Status

A port of the `popular todo.txt-cli project
<https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli>`_ from bash to python.

Information About This Branch
-----------------------------

This will feature a complete rewrite of the script, breaking it out into
classes. My ideal goal is to make an "environment independent" class that is
not tied to console output. The end result should be usable in a web or IM
environment. My personal goal is to be able to use this as a module with the
 `gbin/err`_ chatbot.

.. _gbin/err: https://github.com/gbin/err

The branch will be unstable for a long time, and the end result may not be
fully compatible with the master branch (such as with add-on actions).

Dependencies
------------

This only requires GitPython_ if you want to have todo.py also manage a git
repository which tracks the related files. Running the script once will give
you the URL to download it. Please note that GitPython is written for ``git
--version`` 1.7.2+.

If you're on Windows and running the script out of cmd.exe, install 
colorama for 'termcolor' support.

Installation
------------

From the repo
`````````````
If you want to install the copy locally (i.e. to a personal directory) you can
simply download one of the packages_ and run the ``install.sh`` script.

.. _packages: https://github.com/sigmavirus24/Todo.txt-python/downloads

Be sure to run ``./install.sh -h`` first. You can decide where you would like
the script installed (the default is ``$HOME/bin/``) and where you would like an
alias for the script, e.g., ``t`` or ``tpy``, written (the default is
``$HOME/.bashrc``).

Using pypi
``````````

If you would prefer a system-wide installation, you can use install ``todo.py``
from PyPi like so:

::

    $ pip install todo.py

Be aware that making a system-wide installation will not automattically create
an alias for your use. You will have to edit either your ``.bashrc`` or
``.bash_profile`` (or respective shell configuration filse) to include something
along the lines of:

::

    alias t='$HOME/bin/todo.py'

Hacking

Enjoy, contribute, and feel free to clone. I'm doing this blind [1]_ as best as
possible for fun.

--------

.. [1] By blind, I mean without looking at the source of the original todo.txt-cli
    project. I'm working solely from my experiences with the script and
    experimenting with the functionality while adding things I should probably write
    as patches and send upstream... I'll wait to finish my version of the project
    first though.
